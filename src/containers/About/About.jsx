          <p>
            One or more years of experience in frontend web development, where I
            have been primarily responsible for creating a dark theme library
            for the product I have worked on. Whenever I code, I try to keep the
            number of lines to a minimum and document it properly. I am
            particularly interested in working with React JS with a focus on
            functional components. Every day, I strive to learn something new.
            Despite not understanding the concepts sometimes, I am always
            curious about web development. Along with web development, I am also
            into fitness and enjoy playing basketball üèÄ.
